          </h2>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-dark-charcoal">
            Hartery&apos;s has been a beloved establishment in Stephenville
            since the 1950s, serving as a &apos;home away from home&apos; for
            Americans stationed at the Ernest Harmon Air Force base. Opened and
            owned by Clayton Moraze, it temporarily closed in August 2023 upon
            his retirement, only to be joyfully reopened by Duane Lomond in
            September of the same year.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-dark-charcoal">
            Today, Hartery&apos;s continues its legacy as a family-owned,
            family-style restaurant, proudly serving classic home-style dishes
            and traditional Newfoundland cuisine with a great staff and a
            passionate owner.
